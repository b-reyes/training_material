# training_material
This repository contains all of CU Research Computing's training material, both past and present. 

## Format for repository

To better organize this repository and keep it maintainable, please adhere to these guidelines: 

1. Add presentations to the appropriate year directory e.g. `2024`. 
2. For each year, trainings should be added to the appropriate classification directory: 
    - Quick Bytes
    - Primers
    - Short Courses 
    - Tech Labs
    - Workshops
    - Micro-credentialed Courses
3. Once a year and classification have been chosen, please add your presentation as a directory with the name including the title of the course and the semester it was presented.
